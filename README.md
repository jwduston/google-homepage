My current assignment is to build my first site with HTML. Pretty excited and nervous about this. When I was a kid I really enjoyed building sites through homestead and creating my own styles by using the computers paint program.
Guess I am returning to the idea of doing this and it actually seems pretty intuitive. Better than anticipated.
Between Odin Project and other various on-line forums this has been really simple.
Ready to have coding become second nature and maybe get on with a career in it?

Thus far I have been going through the course load. I am learning how to use the command terminal, how to find/source code from existing sites, git and github basics for my future development.
I will be adding to this as soon as my next lesson is complete.
